Mobile Application User Guide
Login and Registration: Upon launching the app, you will be prompted to log in or register using your credentials. New users must provide basic information to create an account.

Device Status Scanning: Once logged in, the application automatically scans your device for signs of jailbreaking or rooting. This process runs in the background and takes only a few seconds. A notification will appear on the home screen if vulnerabilities are detected.

Viewing Results: After scanning, the app displays a detailed report of your device's security status. 

Notifications: If your device is detected as vulnerable, you will receive a real-time notification. 

Admin Dashboard User Guide
